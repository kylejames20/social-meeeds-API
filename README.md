## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

'''
npm i 
'''

## Usage

First, after installing all required dependencies, you will need to type "npm run start" in the terminal. You will also need the program Insomnia (or one similar) to communicate with your database. The user will be able to see all users, a single user, post new/update current/delete current users, see all thoughts, a single thought, post new/update current/delete current thoughts and be able to react to thoughts.
